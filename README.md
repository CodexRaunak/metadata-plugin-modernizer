### This repository stores the modernization metadata generated by the [plugin-modernizer-tool](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-modernizer-tool).
## What is Modernization Metadata? 
Modernization metadata contains information about automated migrations performed on Jenkins plugins using the `plugin-modernizer-tool`. It includes details such as:
- Pull requests created in the target plugin repositories.
- Whether the migration for a given plugin succeeded or failed.
- Whether the pull request made by the plugin-modernizer-tool was merged or not.
- Other migration-related data points.

## Why it's important?
- **Track progress** – Monitor the modernization process, including successful and failed migrations.
- **Identify issues** – Pinpoint recipes that are consistently failing.
- **Measure improvements** – Assess technical debt reduction over time.

## Repository Structure
`plugin-name/reports/`
- Contains **aggregated migrations** for a specific plugin (all migrations applied to that plugin).
- If a plugin has failed migrations, a `failed-migrations.csv` file will be present in this directory.

`plugin-name/modernization-metadata/`
- Contains individual migration records stored as `timestamp.json` files — one per migration.
- Each migration listed here also appears in the aggregated migrations report.

`/reports/ (root-level)` 
- Contains **summary reports** for the entire modernization process, including PR statistics, migration statistics, and a list of failed plugins.
- `/reports/recipes/` – Contains a `.json` file for each recipe, detailing its application across different plugins.
